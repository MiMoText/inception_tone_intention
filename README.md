# inception_tone_intention

## About

This repository contains the scripts for extracting the statements about tone and intention from the scholarly literature texts annotated in INCEpTION with the purpose of feeding them into the MimoTextBase (https://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page).

The folder inception_output contains the entire transformed inception export, including annotations that do not make it into the MiMoTextBase.
