# inception_tone_intention

## About

This repository contains the scripts for extracting the statements about tone and intention from the scholarly literature texts annotated in INCEpTION with the purpose of feeding them into the MimoTextBase (https://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page).

The folder inception_output contains the entire transformed inception export, including annotations that do not make it into the MiMoTextBase.

## Documentation INCEpTION workflow

The project-specific workflow, starting with the scholarly literature texts as plain text and ending with statements in the form of LOD triples as output, is documented in detail here: https://github.com/MiMoText/inception_tone_intention/blob/main/documentation_inception_workflow.pdf.
